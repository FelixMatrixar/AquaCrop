### Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory. This file will store all the necessary API keys and configuration.

Create a file named `.env` and add the following content, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```env
# Google Gemini API Key
API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Google Maps API Key
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key

# Firebase Configuration
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_firebase_measurement_id
```

**Where to get the keys:**

-   `API_KEY`: Get your Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
-   `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: Get your Google Maps key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis). Make sure to enable the "Maps JavaScript API".
-   `FIREBASE_*`: Get your Firebase configuration from your project's settings in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

### Running the Application

Once you have set up your `.env` file, you can run the development server (assuming a Vite-based setup):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port specified in your terminal) to view the application in your browser.
